# dual-power-supply-12V
This repository will include the necessary schematic and development files for the 12V dual rail power supply project, which was used as a means to provide reliable dual rail power to the analog synthesizer. The original schematic and explanations for design can be found [here]([https://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?CATPARTNO=WALLWARTKIT&PROJARG=WALLWARTSUPPLY%2FWALLWARTSUPPLY.php&MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&SONGID=NONE&VPW=1181&VPH=546]).

The power supply takes in 12V AC (through a wall transformer which converts the main power 120V AC to 12V AC), then splits it to +12V DC, -12V DC, and GND, which is then connected to the analog synthesizer.

Through-hole components were soldered onto the board. Heatsinks were added to voltage regulators for better thermal control.
